# Vowel-Sorter

The user is asked to select a text file from their computer.
By using a treemap data structure, I was able to sort words from the text file. There are 6 sections in the output. Each word starting with a vowel is sorted into its section, and words starting with a consonant are sorted into one section. Words starting with capital letters are above words starting with lower-case letters.
